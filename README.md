# Building Instructions
For building the backup live linux, the debian package linux-live is used. For
dockumentation see their web site. You probably will have to search for
it. The last time I looked it was located at

https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/

This building instruction was tested on a Debian Buster machine.

## Prerequisites
You need the following software for installation:
 - live-build
 
## Creating a bootable USB drive
If you have trouble creating the bootable USB-drive, take a look at [Will
Haley's Debian live Linux building
instructions](https://willhaley.com/blog/custom-debian-live-environment/). These
instructions are build on his blog entry.
